This project is all about diving deep into the data analyst job market to uncover the best opportunities, top skills, and highest-paying roles. Here's how I tackled each aspect:

### 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs 💼

To find the highest-paying positions, I filtered job postings by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote roles. Here's what I discovered:

Wide Salary Range: Top 10 roles offer salaries from $184,000 to a whopping $650,000!
Diverse Employers: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are leading the charge in offering top salaries.
Variety in Job Titles: From Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, the field offers diverse roles with varying specializations.
SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Skills for Top-Paying Jobs 🛠️

To uncover the skills required for these high-paying roles, I joined job postings with skills data. Here's what employers are looking for:

SQL: Leading the pack with demand in 8 out of the top 10 jobs.
Python & Tableau: Close followers, indicating a strong need for programming and visualization skills.
SQL Query:

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN 
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts 📊

This query pinpointed the skills most frequently requested in job postings. Key findings include:

SQL & Excel: Fundamental skills for data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
Python, Tableau, Power BI: Essential for data storytelling and decision support.
SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### 4. Skills Based on Salary 💰

I explored which skills are associated with higher salaries, revealing:

Big Data & Machine Learning: Skills like PySpark, Couchbase, and DataRobot command top salaries.
Software Development & Cloud Computing: Proficiency in tools like GitLab, Kubernetes, and GCP is highly valued.
SQL Query:

```sql

    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn 🏆

By combining demand and salary data, I identified the top skills for maximizing market value:

High-Demand Programming Languages: Python and R are crucial, with significant demand but also widespread availability.
Cloud Tools & BI Platforms: Snowflake, Azure, AWS, and Tableau stand out as key skills for boosting your salary.
SQL Query:

```sql

        skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
